## Introduction
Game: Attack of the Bunnies
Game Tag-Line: Keep enemy projectiles away by shooting at them.

Game Theme: The last remaining ship fights off a swarm of enemies with the ravage bunnies as their leaders. The ship's hull is severely damaged and is vulnerable to immediate destruction if a bunny makes contact with them.

Key Type of Action/Mechanics: The player uses their mouse cursor to aim and fire at incoming enemies, which increases the player’s score, and if an enemy successfully reaches the player, then the player immediately loses and their score is displayed.

Technology: Our video game is going to be a spaceship shooter type of game.
Our video game will be a still background view. With a still background the enemy will spawn in from the borders and approach the player spaceship in the middle.
