## Introduction
Game: Attack of the Bunnies
Game Tag-Line: Keep enemy projectiles away by shooting at them.

Game Theme: The last remaining ship fights off a swarm of enemies with the ravage bunnies as their leaders. The ship's hull is severely damaged and is vulnerable to immediate destruction if a bunny makes contact with them.

Key Type of Action/Mechanics: The player uses their mouse cursor to aim and fire at incoming enemies, which increases the playerâ€™s score, and if an enemy successfully reaches the player, then the player immediately loses and their score is displayed.

Technology: Our video game is going to be a spaceship shooter type of game.
Our video game will be a still background view. With a still background the enemy will spawn in from the borders and approach the player spaceship in the middle.
